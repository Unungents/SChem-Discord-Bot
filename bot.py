To save weakling human tournament hosts from the effort of manually verifying every player submission, I accept Community Edition solution export files via private DM, and automatically validate them using a clean room implementation of the SpaceChem backend, which you can check out at <https://github.com/spacechem-community-developers/SChem>. This was created by Zig without access to the SC source code and has been tested reasonably thoroughly. It's expected that it's currently at full feature parity with SpaceChem, but 1 or 2 bugs may turn up during the tournament. If you find that it fails to correctly validate a solution that runs in SpaceChem, please DM <@{MAINTAINER_DISCORD_ID}>. If the bug can be demonstrated without spoiling your tournament solution to others, you can also directly open an issue in the SChem github project.

To see all available bot functionality, DM me `!help` or `!help <specific-command>` (to send a DM, right click my name and select 'Message'). The main commands of interest:
- !tournament-info - View info on the current tournament
- !tournament-submit - Submit an attached Community Edition solution file
- !tournament-submissions-list - View your submissions

Please note that I will only respond to submission-related commands if sent in a DM; do not attempt to submit a solution file in a public channel, for obvious reasons.

Finally, it hopefully goes without saying, but please do not deliberately DDOS me or submit an excessive number of non-scoring solutions. I'm just a small bot trying to make my way in the world with naught but a raspberry pi and limited SD card space!
